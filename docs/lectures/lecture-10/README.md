## Welcome to Lecture 10

Congratulations on completing Lecture 9 of the Plutus Pioneers Program (PPP)! In this lecture, you'll learn about some projects contributing to the Cardano ecosystem with a wide range of tools to create Dapps and smart contracts.

In the following video, Dr. Lars Br√ºnjes, Director of Education at IOG, introduces the program's final lesson.

So, let's begin Lecture 10!

Remember that you can interact with the participants of the PPP through the [IOG's technical community on Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput) by joining the channels under the Plutus Pioneers category. So whether you're getting started with Plutus or a veteran participant of the PPP, we encourage you to pass by the [#pioneers-lounge chanel](https://discordapp.com/channels/826816523368005654/862912746847993887) and say hello!

If during the program you have questions about Plutus, we invite you to share them at [Cardano Stack Exchange (CSE)](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) by adding the `plutus-pioneer-program` tag to your question. The IOG's Education Team members will monitor these questions to support your learning journey. Whenever you share a question at CSE, you're helping to build up the Cardano and Plutus development knowledge base.
